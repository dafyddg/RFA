Friday

The slides with the background information to Rhythm Formant Theory, and its Rhythm Formant Analysis methodology and software, are on GitHub for your own consumption.

I think that the best strategy today is strictly practical:

First hour: LittleHelper apps

1. Questions arising from apps:
	textgrid2csv.py
	basic_am_demod.py
	basic_am_demod_dev.py

2. 'Pilot experiment' on rhythm regularity:
	(1) record your voice (suggestion: counting)
	(2) with "basic_am_demod_dev.py"
		- identify frequency peaks in the LF spectrum
		- predict average syllable duration in seconds.
	(3) annotate syllables with Praat
	(4) with "textgrid2csv.py" create a CSV file
	(5) read the CSV file into a spreadsheet
		- calculate averate syllable duration from annotation
	(6) informally, compare result with prediction
	(7) analyse the CSV file with TGA:
		- http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/gibbon/TGA/

3. F0 estimation (FM demodulation)
	- from GitHub
		download "basic_fm_demod.py" and the .WAV files
	- check different voices
		- "basic_fm_demod.py <soundfile.wav> counting|mlk|putonghua>"

Break

Second hour:

1. Directory "RFA_single_signal_processing"
	- full RFA visualisation
2. Directory "RFA_multiple_signal_processing"
	- comparison with unsupervised machine learning
